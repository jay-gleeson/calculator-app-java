# Java Calculator App 🧮
Calculator app built in Java.

## Background 🏞️
As a student taking a short, 8-week Java Programming class over the summer, a decision was made to get a head start by creating a classic: the Calculator App. A staple among beginner programmers, this project was chosen as the primary challenge to complete over the coming weeks while gaining a deeper understanding of Java. Though the initial app may be rough, as knowledge of Java practices and principles grows throughout the course, the app is expected to improve and evolve into a solid starter project.

This calculator app was created with the help of various resources, especially a java calculator tutorial presented by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfhmTyRTCSQ).

## Tools 🛠️
This project utilizes various tools and libraries, like the following:
- **[Java](https://www.java.com/en/):** Programming language to facilitate underlying logic.
- **[Swing (javax.swing)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html):** For building the graphical user interface.
- **[AWT (java.awt)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html):** For layout management and fonts.
- **[AWT Event (java.awt.event)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/event/package-summary.html):** For handling user interactions/events.
