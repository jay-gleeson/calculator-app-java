# Java Calculator App 🧮
Calculator app built in Java using JOptionPane.

## Background 🏞️
As a student taking a short, 8-week Java Programming class over the Summer. I decided to get a head start on the class by creating a classic. The Calculator App. A staple among beginner programmers, I have made this my primary challenge to complete within the coming weeks as my understanding of Java grows as I continue to take the class. While the initial app may be rough, as I learn practices and values of the Java programming language, it will surely improve and finally be a good starter project!

Note, the learning content of this class is quite archaic from what I can tell, so once again, the initial app may be rough and outdated, based on the fact this class primarily recommends JDK 11 or 1.6. 

## Tools 🛠️
This project will utilize various tools and libraries, like the following:
- **[Java](https://www.java.com/en/):** Programming language to facilitate underlying logic.
- **[JOptionPane](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/JOptionPane.html):** Java class for creating the dialog box.

## Instructions 📝
   1. Clone the repo
   ```bash 
      git clone https://github.com/jay-gleeson/java-app-calculator.git

   ```
   2. Compile
   ```
      javac -d out src/Calculator.java
