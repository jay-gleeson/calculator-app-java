# Java Calculator App üßÆ
Calculator app built in Java.

# Background ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Developed during an 8-week summer seesion Java Programming Course as a fun side-project to distract from assignments. Utilizes common implementations of Java libraries like frames, drawing, and button listening. Code written to be easily understandable and efficient for future use. All simple computations are allowed; addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Multiple operations can be performed, app allows negative values, as well as decimal values. 
Takes significant inspiration from [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfhmTyRTCSQ).

## Tools üõ†Ô∏è
This project utilizes various tools and libraries, like the following:
- **[Java](https://www.java.com/en/):** Programming language to facilitate underlying logic.
- **[Swing (javax.swing)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html):** For building the graphical user interface.
- **[AWT (java.awt)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html):** For layout management and fonts.
- **[AWT Event (java.awt.event)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/event/package-summary.html):** For handling user interactions/events.

# Future Work ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
* **Implement Order of Operations**: Include PEMDAS and perform operations in the order of operations. 
* **Smart Error Handling**: Handle division by zero, and missing second number or operator.
* **Add more Algebraic Expressions**: Include log, ln, e, pi, fractions, etc..
